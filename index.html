      <p>This is a rudimentary tool, because as you'll see if you read the ReadMe in the [repo](https://github.com/krkwd/tensorithm-tarot), I'm not a developer. It can output 1 to 5 cards. No patterns. No Celtic Cross. But even with these limitations, there are some useful approaches to getting the guidance you seek.
      </p>
      <p>A few examples:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Single Card Reading:</b> Draw a single card to gain insight into a specific question or situation. The card represents the energies and guidance related to the inquiry. This can also be a YES/NO question, with the answer being up to the seeker's interpretation of the meaning and symbolism, and how it relates to the question</li>
          <li><b>Two Card Reading:</b> <i>Present and future</i>. Draw two cards to gain insight into the current situation, and guidance on how to move forward.</li>
          <li><b>Two Card Reading:</b> <i>Forking paths</i>. Draw two cards to gain insight into the current situation, and guidance on how to move forward.</li>
          <li><b>Three Card Reading:</b> <i>Past, present, future</i>. Past influences, present circumstances, future possibilities will be revealed.</li>
          <li><b>Three Card Reading:</b> <i>Decision-making</i>. Draw three cards to view three possible solutions to a problem or challenge. Each card represents a choice or aspect to consider, helping the seeker gain clarity.</li>
  Celtic  <li>Five Card Reading:<b>: <i>Modified Celtic Cross</i>.  Draw five cards to represent different aspects of a situation, such as the present influences, challenges, guidance, and potential outcomes.</li>
          <ul><li>Your current state of being</li>
          <li>Your current influence or obstacle</li>
          <li>The origin of your influence of obstacle</li>
          <li>The outcome if you follow your current path</li>
          <li>The outcome if you follow the path the fifth card presents</li>
          </ul></ul>
         
Or come up with your own techniques. There are no wrong approaches to tarot as long as your question is clear and you are open to accepting the answers presented.
